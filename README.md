# Bloom

Bloom is a visually appealing mouseover experiment. Simply scan your cursor over the canvas and watch the seeds emerge. These little seeds will burst into a world of colors and sounds.

### MVP
Upon canvas mouseover, users will experience:
- [ ] Small seeds emanating from the cursor
- [ ] Seeds falling and bouncing around the screen
- [ ] Blooms bursting out of the seeds
- [ ] Sound effects of blooms opening
- [ ] Optional settings to change visuals/sound

### Wireframe

Bloom will consist of an interactive canvas. Several controls will be accessible to the user for optional settings. Links to GitHub and LinkedIn will be present.

Objects will appear when the mouse is over the canvas.
